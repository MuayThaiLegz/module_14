# Working the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. 

* Goal
------

Enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
------

## Explanation
* Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.
* Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.
* Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.
------

## Technologies 
# Pandas
We used Pandas

* Importing the data.
* Creating SMA DataFrames with Pandas methods.
* Using Pandas methods on our dataframes.
------
```
# Import the OHLCV dataset into a Pandas Dataframe
ohlcv_df = pd.read_csv(
    Path("./Resources/emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv"), 
    index_col='date', 
    infer_datetime_format=True, 
    parse_dates=True
)

# Review the DataFrame
ohlcv_df.head()

# Set the short window and long window
short_window = 4
long_window = 100

# Generate the fast and slow simple moving averages (4 and 100 days, respectively)
signals_df['SMA_Fast'] = signals_df['close'].rolling(window=short_window).mean()
signals_df['SMA_Slow'] = signals_df['close'].rolling(window=long_window).mean()

signals_df = signals_df.dropna()

# Review the DataFrame
display(signals_df.head())
display(signals_df.tail())

# Select the start of the training period
training_begin = X.index.min()

# Select the ending period for the training data with an offset of 3 months
training_end = X.index.min() + DateOffset(months=3)

# Generate the X_train and y_train DataFrames
X_train = X.loc[training_begin:training_end]
y_train = y.loc[training_begin:training_end]

# Review the X_train DataFrame
X_train.head()

Package overview
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

# Scikit-learn
We used Scikit-learn 

* We used StandardScaler to Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
* We used Transform to perform standardization by centering and scaling.
* We used classification report to evaluate the model

```
# Scale the features DataFrames

# Create a StandardScaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Apply the scaler model to fit the X-train data
X_scaler = scaler.fit(X_train)

# Transform the X_train and X_test DataFrames using the X_scaler
X_train_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a StandardScaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler to the features training dataset
X_scaler = scaler.fit(X_train)  

X_train_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_train)

X_test_scaled = X_scaler.transform(X_test)

# Use a classification report to evaluate the model using the predictions and testing data
svm_testing_report = classification_report(y_test, test_svm_pred)

# Print the classification report
# YOUR CODE HERE
print(svm_testing_report)
```
